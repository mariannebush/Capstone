# Explanation of Project

The World Happiness Report is a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board. The report is produced under the editorial control of the WHR Editorial Board.

The World Happiness Report reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

I decided to investigate the data to determine what trends I could discover.

Features

1) Loading Data: Reading in two CSVs
2) Clean and operate on the data: Merged .csv files and eliminated missing data
3) Visualize and present the data: Tableau Dashboard
4) Best Practices: Virtual environment and a data dictionary
5) Interpretation of the data: Summarized at the end of this Readme

# How to Run My Project and Best Practices

In order to run my project, you will need Git and Jupyter Notebook. 
* To install Git, please follow the instructions on Git's website: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
* To install Jupyter Notebook, please follow the instructions on Jupyter's website: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

Once you have installed the software, please navigate to my repository and clone it. You can find instructions on how to clone a repository on Git's website: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Open Git and enter the following commands to create a virtual environment:

#### Windows

python -m venv venv

source venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Linux/Mac0S

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


After the virtual environment is created, enter “git clone” followed by the URL you copied when cloning the repository. Navigate to where you cloned the repository. Run the file “Happiness.ipynb. In order to exit the virtual environment enter "deactivate".
