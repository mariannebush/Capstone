# How to Run My Project and Best Practices

In order to run my project, you will need Git and Jupyter Notebook. 
* To install Git, please follow the instructions on Git's website: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
* To install Jupyter Notebook, please follow the instructions on Jupyter's website: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

Once you have installed the software, please navigate to my repository and clone it. You can find instructions on how to clone a repository on Git's website: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Open Git and enter the following commands to create a virtual environment:

#### Windows

python -m venv venv

source venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Linux/Mac0S

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


After the virtual environment is created, enter “git clone” followed by the URL you copied when cloning the repository. Navigate to where you cloned the repository. Run the file “Happiness”

•	To exit the virtual environment type “deactivate” in the git/terminal window.
